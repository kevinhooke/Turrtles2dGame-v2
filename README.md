# Turtles - a simple Java 2d game, 2007
Simple Java 2d api based game using 2dGamesEngine that I wrote (https://github.com/kevinhooke/2dGameEngine2007). 

This is the original version from 2007 which I thought I'd share on GutHub in case anyone's interested
in doing something similar.

The game works and is playable, but there's a few bugs in the sprite positioning. I might take a go
at fixing these and tidying it up a bit :-)
